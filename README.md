# discord-bot-python
Discord bot will be built in Python and perform various tasks such as responding to certain phrases and words, performing random rolls, and more!
Wanted to start tinkering around with a bot for an application that I use regularly. I want to add more functionality like playing music when joining
a voice channel or giving a fun fact of the day or something along those lines.
